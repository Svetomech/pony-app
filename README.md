This is an app that makes a pony walk across my taskbar. I got these
GIFs from the Desktop Ponies application (CC-BY-NC-SA-3) but the app
was too... busy... for what I wanted. I also didn't want ponies all
over my bloody desktop. I just want the one to traverse across the
taskbar.

Eventually I want to make her do work for me, like if I click her and
just type "google whatever" she starts up chrome and does it.

## Technical Blah Blah Blah

This is a Visual C# Project. I don't know jack about what I am doing.
Therefore I COMMITED ALL THE THINGS to the Githubs including that
solution and options file and whatever else is in this cluster folder.
If that was wrong oh well.

I have never written a line of C# in my life until now. This could be
the worst application ever written in that language I have no clue.
This is my learning introduction project. My knowledge of the language
comes purely from reading what Visual Studio bitches about when I do
something dumb, and my experience in real languages like straight C.

That joke aside, it actually is an interesting language. So far I am
enjoying myself... but I'm also getting a pony out of it as a reward
so that might just be a novelty feeling.

The only reason I went with C# was because GTK still does not support
RGBA colormaps on Windows. Durr. This would have been a PHP-GTK app
if not for that. Windows WPF was the only thing that would render a
transparent window without me having to do 400 lines of code so here
it is.

## Legal Blah Blah Blah

Not affiliated with Hasbro... duh.

I did not make the artwork. They are animated GIF's from the project
on http://desktopponies.com/ - And they are awesome.
